For all things from and for The Odin Project

This is MJae's nth git project!

More Ruby.

## Day 17: 2020 August 13
This is when Ruby starts.

I hit a bit of a snag during installation... Or I thought I did. It turns out, the version was only not updating because the terminal needed to restart. Version update went as well as it could have.

The calculator project still has a bug in it. However, I don't want to dwell too long on it, so I'm deciding to move forward instead.

So, now, I have compelted The Odin Project's Web Development 101!
